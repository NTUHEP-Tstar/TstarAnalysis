# CompareDataMC

Making simple comparison of data and monte carlo by dumping file content information.

### KinematicCompare
Display various kinematic variables. For each kinematic variable, four plots are produced, one is the simple version, the other is in log scale. Next the monte carlo is scaled to the data, and the two plots are drawn again. To change the Kinematic variables plotted, add a new histogram and it's corresponding filling into `src/SampleHistMgr.cc` 


### MakeSummaryTable
Generating the selection results in Latex tabular format.
